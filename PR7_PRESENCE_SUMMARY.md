# PR #7: User Presence System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks (8/9)

### Implementation Complete
All core presence functionality has been implemented and tested:

1. **✅ 7.1: Presence Schema Design**
   - Designed Firebase Realtime Database schema at `/sessions/global-canvas-v1/{userId}`
   - Schema includes: displayName, cursorColor, cursorX, cursorY, lastSeen

2. **✅ 7.2: Presence Service** (`src/services/presence.js`)
   - `setUserOnline(userId, displayName, color)` - Sets user as online with auto-disconnect cleanup
   - `setUserOffline(userId)` - Manually sets user offline
   - `subscribeToPresence(callback)` - Real-time subscription to presence changes
   - `updateCursorPosition(userId, x, y)` - Updates cursor position (shared with cursor feature)

3. **✅ 7.3: Presence Hook** (`src/hooks/usePresence.js`)
   - Automatically sets user online on mount
   - Subscribes to presence changes
   - Returns `onlineUsers` array and `isConnected` status
   - Auto-cleanup on unmount

4. **✅ 7.4: Presence List Component** (`src/components/Collaboration/PresenceList.jsx`)
   - Displays roster of online users
   - Shows user count (e.g., "3 users")
   - Each user shown with color dot + name
   - Marks current user with "(you)" label
   - Includes green online indicator
   - Scrollable list (max 400px height)

5. **✅ 7.5: User Presence Badge** (`src/components/Collaboration/UserPresence.jsx`)
   - Avatar showing user initial
   - Colored background using user's assigned color
   - Tooltip on hover with full name
   - Smooth hover animation (scale effect)

6. **✅ 7.6: Navbar Integration** (`src/components/Layout/Navbar.jsx`)
   - Added online user count indicator in navbar
   - Shows green dot + count (e.g., "3 online")

7. **✅ 7.7: App Integration** (`src/App.jsx`)
   - Integrated usePresence hook
   - Positioned PresenceList on right side below navbar (top: 60px, right: 16px)
   - Passes online users and current user ID to components
   - Auto-cleanup on unmount

8. **✅ 7.8: Presence Service Tests** (`tests/unit/services/presence.test.js`)
   - 12 comprehensive unit tests
   - Tests for setUserOnline with all edge cases
   - Tests for setUserOffline
   - Tests for subscribeToPresence callback handling
   - Tests for data structure validation
   - Tests for error handling
   - **All 12/12 tests passing** ✅

9. **⏸️ 7.9: Integration Tests** (Deferred)
   - Deferred to later for MVP (similar to PR #2)
   - Manual testing sufficient for initial release

## 🎨 UI Features

### Presence Roster
- **Location**: Right side of screen, below navbar (absolutely positioned)
- **Styling**: Clean white card with shadow
- **Header**: Shows "Active Users" title and user count badge
- **User List**: 
  - Each user has colored avatar with initial
  - Full name displayed next to avatar
  - Current user marked with "(you)"
  - Green online indicator dot
  - Hover effects for better UX
  - Scrollable if many users

### Navbar Indicator
- **Location**: Top navbar, center-right area
- **Display**: Green dot + "X online" text
- **Updates**: Real-time as users join/leave

## 🔗 Data Flow

```
User Loads App
    ↓
usePresence Hook Initializes
    ↓
setUserOnline(userId, displayName, color)
    ↓
Firebase RTDB: /sessions/global-canvas-v1/{userId}
    ↓
subscribeToPresence() listens for changes
    ↓
onlineUsers array updates in real-time
    ↓
PresenceList & Navbar components re-render
    ↓
User Leaves → onDisconnect() auto-cleanup
```

## 🎯 User Colors

Uses existing `generateUserColor()` helper from `src/utils/helpers.js`:
- Consistent color per user (hash-based on userId)
- 10 distinct colors in palette
- High contrast for visibility
- Shared between presence and cursor features

## 📝 Files Created

1. `src/services/presence.js` - Core presence service
2. `src/hooks/usePresence.js` - React hook for presence
3. `src/components/Collaboration/PresenceList.jsx` - Main roster component
4. `src/components/Collaboration/UserPresence.jsx` - Individual user badge
5. `tests/unit/services/presence.test.js` - Comprehensive unit tests

## 📝 Files Modified

1. `src/App.jsx` - Integrated presence system
2. `src/components/Layout/Navbar.jsx` - Added online count indicator
3. `tasks.md` - Updated task completion status

## 🚀 Ready for Manual Testing

The presence system is now ready for browser testing:

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Open app in one browser → should see yourself in roster
2. Open app in another browser (different user) → both users should see each other
3. Close one browser → user should disappear from other's roster
4. Refresh page → presence should persist
5. Count in navbar should match number of users in roster

**Firebase Setup Required:**
- Ensure Firebase Realtime Database is created
- Database URL should be in `.env` file
- No special rules needed yet (will add in deployment PR)

## 🎉 Status

**PR #7 is COMPLETE and ready for user acceptance testing!**

All core functionality implemented, tested, and documented.
Next up: Manual testing in browser with multiple users.
