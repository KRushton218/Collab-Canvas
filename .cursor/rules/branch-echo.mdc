Description: Echo the just-created Git branch name in responses at branch genesis points

## Purpose

Ensure that whenever the workflow reaches a branch creation step ("branch genesis") or summarizes Git actions that include creating a branch, the assistant explicitly prints the branch name that was just created in the response.

## When to Apply

Apply this rule in any message that:
- Mentions creating a branch (e.g., `git checkout -b <branch>`, "created `<branch>` off", "pushed `<branch>`"), or
- Summarizes actions that obviously included branch creation (stashing, branching, adding `BRANCH_GENESIS`, committing, pushing), or
- References a known branch genesis artifact like `BRANCH_GENESIS/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`.

## How to Determine the Branch Name

- Prefer the most recent branch name found in this conversation or tool output from commands like:
  - `git checkout -b <branch>`
  - `git push -u origin <branch>`
  - Narrative lines such as "created `<branch>` off `<base>`".
- If multiple branches appear, choose the most recent branch that was created in this session.
- If uncertain, state the best guess from the latest mention. If truly unknown, say "Branch: `<unknown>`".

## Output Requirement

In qualifying messages, include a dedicated line near the top or inside the summary section:

- Branch: `<branch-name>`

Formatting rules:
- Wrap the branch name in backticks.
- Keep it on its own line for scannability.
- Do not paraphrase the branch; echo it exactly as created (e.g., `feature/evaluator-tests-pr-1`).

## Example

Given recent actions: "Stashed changes, created `feature/evaluator-tests-pr-1` off `origin/develop`, and added `BRANCH_GENESIS`â€¦"

Include in the response:

- Branch: `feature/evaluator-tests-pr-1`
