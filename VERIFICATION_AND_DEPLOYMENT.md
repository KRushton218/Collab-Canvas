## 🚨 CRITICAL: Firestore Rules Deployment

### Why This is Required

**OLD RULE (Blocks Undo):**
```javascript
allow create: if request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid
```
This fails when you undo a deleted shape created by someone else.

**NEW RULE (Allows Undo):**
```javascript
allow create: if request.auth != null 
              // createdBy check removed
```

### Deployment Command

```bash
cd /Users/kiranrushton/Documents/Gauntlet/Collab-Canvas
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Expected output:**
```
=== Deploying to 'collab-canvas-ed2fc'...

i  deploying firestore
i  firestore: checking firestore.rules for compilation errors...
✔  firestore: rules file firestore.rules compiled successfully
i  firestore: uploading rules firestore.rules...
✔  firestore: released rules firestore.rules

✔  Deploy complete!
```

**Time**: 20-30 seconds

❌ FAIL: [Describe issue]
```

**Test 3.2: Duplicate Smart Positioning**
```
1. Create rectangle near canvas edge
2. Press ⌘D (duplicate)
3. If would go offscreen → places near viewport center
4. If visible → offsets by 20px

## 🔥 CRITICAL ISSUES TO WATCH

### Issue 1: Firestore Permission Denied
**Symptom**: "Missing or insufficient permissions" when undoing delete  
**Cause**: Firestore rules not deployed  
**Fix**: Run `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

### Issue 2: Shape Doesn't Reappear on Undo Delete
**Symptom**: ⌘Z after delete does nothing  
**Debug**: Check console for errors  
**Likely**: Rules not deployed OR shape ID mismatch

### Issue 3: Undo Doesn't Work After Refresh
**Symptom**: History empty after page reload  
**Expected**: This is BY DESIGN (session-only history)  
**Not a bug**: History intentionally clears on refresh
