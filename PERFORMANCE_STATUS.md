# Performance Optimization - Current Status

## Your Issue
**641 shapes**: Cmd+A freezes page, can't drag shapes

## What I've Fixed ✅

### Critical Optimizations Deployed
1. ✅ **Shared Heartbeat** - 641 timers → 1 timer (99.8% reduction)
2. ✅ **Batch Lock Acquisition** - 1,282 ops → 2 ops (99.8% reduction)
3. ✅ **Batch Lock Release** - 641 ops → 2 ops (99.7% reduction)
4. ✅ **Batch Active Edits** - All multi-shape RTDB operations batched

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/realtimeShapes.js` - All batch RTDB operations
- `src/contexts/CanvasContext.jsx` - Optimized logging

## Test Now

Please **refresh localhost** and try:
1. **Cmd+A** to select 641 shapes
2. **Try to drag** the selection

**Check browser console** for these logs:
```
[SelectMultiple] Attempting to select 641 shapes
[startEditingMultipleShapes] Starting batch edit for 641 shapes  
[startEditingMultipleShapes] Successfully started edit for 641 shapes
```

## Expected Results

### What Should Work Now
✅ **Selection** should be instant (<100ms)  
✅ **Lock acquisition** should be fast (<100ms)

### What May Still Lag
⚠️ **Dragging** may still feel slow because Konva still processes 641 shapes individually per frame

## If Drag Still Lags...

### The Remaining Bottleneck
Even with batched RTDB/Firestore, **Konva rendering layer** still calls:
- 641 × `onDragMove()` per frame
- 641 × position calculations  
- 641 × shape re-renders

At 60 FPS: **153,840 operations/second** → browser struggles

### The Complete Solution: SelectionGroup

I've created the architecture to treat multi-selection as a **single entity**:

**Components Ready**:
- ✅ `src/models/SelectionGroup.js` - Data model
- ✅ `src/components/Canvas/SelectionGroupNode.jsx` - Konva component
- ⚠️ Canvas.jsx integration - needs refactoring

**What SelectionGroup Provides**:
- 1 × `onDragMove()` per frame (not 641!)
- 1 × group calculation
- 1 × batch update
- **Result**: 240 ops/second instead of 153,840 → **smooth!**

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Test current build** - verify batch optimizations work
2. **Report back** - does selection work? Does drag work?

### If Drag Still Lags
1. Complete Canvas.jsx integration with SelectionGroupNode
2. This is the proper architectural solution
3. Will make 641-shape drag feel like single-shape drag

## Files Created

**Batch Optimizations**:
- `src/services/realtimeShapes.js` - ✅ Complete
- `src/contexts/CanvasContext.jsx` - ✅ Complete

**SelectionGroup Architecture**:
- `src/models/SelectionGroup.js` - ✅ Ready
- `src/components/Canvas/SelectionGroupNode.jsx` - ✅ Ready
- `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx` - ⚠️ Needs integration

**Documentation**:
- `docs/LARGE_SELECTION_OPTIMIZATION.md`
- `docs/SELECTION_GROUP_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS.md`
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Updated

## Bottom Line

**Phase 1** (batch RTDB/Firestore): ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Phase 2** (SelectionGroup rendering): ⚠️ **Architecture ready, integration needed**

**Please test Phase 1 first, then let me know if drag is still slow. If yes, I'll complete Phase 2 integration immediately.**
