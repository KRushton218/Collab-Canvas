## 🧪 CRITICAL: Production Testing Required

### Immediate Tests (5 minutes)

**Open**: https://collab-canvas-ed2fc.web.app

**Test 1: Undo Delete (CRITICAL)**
```
1. Sign in
2. Create a rectangle
3. Delete it (press Delete key)
4. Press ⌘Z (undo)
5. Watch console for: "Waiting for Firestore sync (500ms)..."
6. Rectangle should reappear after ~500ms
7. Check: NO "permission denied" errors

✅ PASS: Undo delete works (Firestore rules deployed!)
❌ FAIL: Permission error → Rules didn't deploy (re-run deployment)
```

**Test 2: Z-Index**
```
1. Create 3 overlapping rectangles
2. Select middle one
3. Press ⌘]
4. Should jump to front

✅ PASS: Z-index works
❌ FAIL: [Report issue]
```

**Test 3: Keyboard Shortcuts**
```
Test each:
⌘C/⌘V - Copy/paste
⌘D - Duplicate
⌘A - Select all
⌘Z/⌘⇧Z - Undo/redo
⌘]/⌘[ - Bring front/send back
Arrows - Nudge shapes
V/R/C/L/T - Tool shortcuts

✅ PASS: All shortcuts work
❌ FAIL: [List which failed]
```

**Test 4: Multi-User (10 minutes)**
```
Open 2 browser windows:
1. Both users create shapes
2. User A: ⌘Z → only A's shapes undo
3. User B: ⌘Z → only B's shapes undo
4. Verify: Separate undo histories

✅ PASS: Collaborative undo works
❌ FAIL: [Describe issue]
```

## 🎯 What to Test Now

### Priority 1: Undo/Redo (Most Important)
```
Undo delete is the critical test because it required rules changes.

Test sequence:
1. Create → Delete → ⌘Z → Should reappear
2. Create → ⌘Z → Should disappear
3. Move → ⌘Z → Should move back
4. Color → ⌘Z → Should revert color
5. Multiple undos → ⌘⇧Z multiple redos

Expected: All work without errors
```

### Priority 2: All New Features
```
- Z-index (overlapping shapes)
- Copy/paste (viewport centering)
- Duplicate (smart positioning)
- Arrow keys (1px and 10px movement)
- Select all (⌘A)
- Help overlay (? button)
```

### Priority 3: Previous Fixes
```
- Line endpoint dragging
- Circle resize anchor
- Text centered placement
- ESC deselect priority
- Lock name labels
- Border thickness controls
```
