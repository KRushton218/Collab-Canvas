# Deployment Checklist - Updated Rules

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ⚠️ Firestore rules MUST be redeployed  
**Critical**: Undo/redo will fail without updated rules

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Deploy Updated Firestore Rules

### What Changed
**File**: `firestore.rules`

**Change**: Removed `createdBy` validation to allow undo operations
```javascript
// BEFORE (blocks undo):
allow create: if request.auth != null 
              && request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid  // ← Blocks undo!
              
// AFTER (allows undo):
allow create: if request.auth != null 
              // createdBy check removed
```

**Why**: When you undo a delete, the shape is recreated with its ORIGINAL `createdBy` field, which might not match the current user. The old rule would block this.

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

### Deploy Firestore Rules Only (Fast)
```bash
cd /Users/kiranrushton/Documents/Gauntlet/Collab-Canvas
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Time**: ~30 seconds  
**Impact**: Only updates security rules, doesn't affect hosting

### Deploy Everything (If needed)
```bash
cd /Users/kiranrushton/Documents/Gauntlet/Collab-Canvas
npm run firebase:deploy
```

**Time**: ~2-3 minutes  
**Impact**: Rebuilds and deploys entire app + rules

---

## ✅ Verification After Deployment

### Test Undo Delete:
```
1. Create a shape
2. Delete it
3. Press ⌘Z (undo)
4. Check console for errors
5. Expected: Shape reappears (no Firestore permission errors)
```

**If you see**: `FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions`  
**Solution**: Rules not deployed → run `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
