## MVP Completion Checklist

### Required Features:

- [X] Basic canvas with pan/zoom (5000x5000px with boundaries) ✅
- [X] Initial canvas view centered at (2500, 2500) ✅
- [X] Rectangle shapes (enhanced: configurable colors, not just #cccccc) ✅
- [X] Ability to create, move, resize, and delete objects ✅
- [X] Object locking (enhanced: lock on drag/transform, not just selection) ✅
- [X] Lock releases on drag/transform end ✅
- [X] Real-time sync between 2+ users (<100ms) ✅
- [X] Locked shapes visible and update in real-time for other users ✅
- [X] Multiplayer cursors with name labels and unique colors ✅
- [X] Presence awareness (who's online) ✅
- [X] User authentication (email/password AND Google login) ✅
- [ ] Deployed and publicly accessible (configured, not deployed yet)

### Performance Targets:

- [X] 60 FPS during all interactions ✅
- [X] Shape changes sync in <100ms ✅
- [X] Cursor positions sync smoothly (150ms throttle) ✅
- [X] Support 100+ objects without FPS drops ✅ (500+ untested)
- [X] Support 5+ concurrent users without degradation ✅

### Automated Testing Requirements:

- [X] **All unit tests pass (`npm test`)** - 62/62 passing ✅
- [X] **Manual testing approach adopted** (see testing-strategy.md) ✅
- [X] Test coverage reviewed and documented ✅
- [X] No failing tests ✅

### Manual Testing Scenarios:

- [X] 2 users editing simultaneously in different browsers ✅
- [X] User A drags shape → shape locks, User B cannot interact with it ✅
- [X] User A moves locked shape → User B sees real-time updates (but cannot edit) ✅
- [X] User A releases drag → User B can now select and move it ✅
- [X] User A deletes unlocked shape created by User B → disappears for User B immediately ✅
- [X] One user refreshing mid-edit confirms state persistence ✅
- [X] Multiple shapes created and moved rapidly - sync works smoothly ✅
- [X] Tested with 100+ rectangles - performance good ✅ (500+ untested)
