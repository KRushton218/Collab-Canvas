# Session Archives - Temporary Documentation

This file consolidates temporary session documentation that was previously spread across the root directory. These files are kept for reference but should not be actively maintained as they become stale quickly.

## Session: October 16, 2025 - Performance Optimization Sprint

### Key Achievements
- Implemented Firestore batch commits (99% reduction in writes for bulk operations)
- Optimized large selection handling (641 shapes)
- Implemented viewport culling
- Fixed RTDBâ†’Firestore sync race conditions
- Implemented optimistic locking
- Refactored canvas architecture for lazy loading

### Documentation Files (Archived)
- **COMPLETE_PERFORMANCE_SOLUTION.md** - Complete overview of all optimizations
- **FINAL_PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.md** - Performance metrics and benchmarks
- **PERFORMANCE_STATUS.md** - Deployment status at time of session
- **REFRESH_AND_TEST.md** - Testing checklist for the session
- **SESSION_SUMMARY_OCT16.md** - Original session notes
- **TEST_NOW.md** - Testing procedures documented

### Related Technical Documents (Active Reference)
- `docs/LARGE_SELECTION_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Root cause analysis and solution
- `docs/BATCH_OPERATIONS_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` - Firestore batch patterns
- `docs/EDGE_CASES_AND_RTDB_FIRESTORE_SYNC.md` - Edge case analysis
- `docs/FIRESTORE_RULES_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Security rules improvements
- `docs/SELECTION_GROUP_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Group transform architecture
- `docs/VIEWPORT_CULLING.md` - Rendering optimization
- `docs/OPTIMISTIC_LOCKING.md` - Lock state management

## Notes on Archived Files
- Temporary session files are kept in root for quick reference
- Consider archiving or deleting after verification of implementation
- Technical implementation is documented in `docs/` folder (primary reference)
- Memory bank contains current architecture and decisions

## Future Sessions
When adding new session notes:
1. Create comprehensive documentation in `docs/` for technical details
2. Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with current state
3. Consider whether root-level temporary files are still needed
4. Archive old session files periodically to keep root clean
