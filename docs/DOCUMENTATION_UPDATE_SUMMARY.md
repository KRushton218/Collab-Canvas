  - What's partially complete (PR #8, PR #9)
  - Current focus (shape type rendering)
  - Documentation status

**Purpose**: Historical reference showing original development plan and what was actually completed.

### 3. **current-todos.md** - Active Task List (NEW)
**Status**: ✅ Created fresh document for ongoing work

**Contents**:
- **High Priority**: Implement Circle, Line, Text shape rendering (5 tasks)
- **Medium Priority**: Tool mode improvements, property panel
- **Low Priority**: Mobile responsiveness, Phase 2 features
- **Testing Status**: 62/62 unit tests passing
- **Known Issues**: Shape type rendering limitation documented
- **Deployment Status**: Configured but not deployed

**Purpose**: Clear, actionable task list for current and future development work.

### 4. **testing-strategy.md** - Testing Approach & User Stories (NEW)
**Status**: ✅ Created comprehensive testing documentation

**Contents**:
- **Testing Philosophy**: Why manual testing approach was adopted
- **Current Test Coverage**: 
  - 8 auth tests ✅
  - 12 presence tests ✅
  - 42 canvas/helpers tests ✅
  - Total: 62/62 passing
- **Comprehensive User Story Test Suite**: 45+ user stories covering:
  - Category 1: Authentication & Session Management (5 stories)
  - Category 2: Canvas Navigation & Viewport (3 stories)
  - Category 3: Shape Creation & Basic Manipulation (6 stories)
  - Category 4: Shape Styling (1 story)
  - Category 5: Real-Time Collaboration (10 stories)
  - Category 6: Persistence & State Management (4 stories)
  - Category 7: Edge Cases & Error Handling (4 stories)
  - Category 8: UI/UX Verification (5 stories)
- **Quick Smoke Test**: 8-step rapid verification checklist
- **Test Execution Tracking**: When to test, reporting issues

**Purpose**: Provides complete functional test coverage similar to "the quick brown fox" for keyboards - running these stories confirms all features work.

## 🎯 Key Decisions Documented

### Architecture Evolution
- **Original**: Single Firestore document with shapes array
- **Improvement**: One document per shape for O(1) operations
- **Rationale**: Scalability, concurrent edits, write performance, future-proofing
- **Impact**: Consistent performance regardless of shape count

### Testing Approach
- **Decision**: Manual testing for visual/interactive features
- **Rationale**: Visual nature, real-time interactions, multi-user scenarios
- **Coverage**: 62 unit tests + comprehensive user story suite
- **Status**: All tests passing, manual scenarios validated

### Beyond-MVP Enhancements
- **Color Picker**: Fixed gray → configurable colors
- **Resize Handles**: Fixed size → interactive resize
- **Visual Locks**: No indicators → colored borders
- **Toolbar**: Basic button → modern icon-based interface
- **Profile Photos**: Name only → Google photo integration

## 📊 Project Status Summary

### Completed ✅
- Core MVP requirements (all 11 features)
- Real-time collaboration (cursors, presence, locking)
- Authentication (email + Google)
- Canvas rendering (pan, zoom, boundaries)
- Shape CRUD (create, drag, resize, delete)
- Beyond-MVP enhancements (6 major features)
- Testing infrastructure (62 tests, user story suite)

### In Progress 🚧
- **Shape Type Rendering**: UI exists, need Circle/Line/Text components
- Tool mode improvements
- Property panel for shape editing

### Not Started / Deferred
- Production deployment (configured, not deployed)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Phase 2 features (undo/redo, multi-select, etc.)

## 🎉 Result

CollabCanvas now has:
1. ✅ Clear historical record of MVP development (PRD.md, tasks.md)
2. ✅ Active task list for ongoing work (current-todos.md)
3. ✅ Comprehensive testing strategy (testing-strategy.md)
4. ✅ Well-documented architecture decisions and rationale
5. ✅ Memory bank as primary source of truth for current state

**Next Steps**: Use `current-todos.md` for active development, refer to `memory-bank/` for context, run user stories from `testing-strategy.md` before releases.
