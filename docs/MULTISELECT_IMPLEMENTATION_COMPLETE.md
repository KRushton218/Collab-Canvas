## üì¶ Implemented Features

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Multiselect
- **Selection State**: Changed from `selectedId` (single) to `selectedIds` (Set)
- **Selection Methods**:
  - `toggleSelection(id)` - Toggle single shape (Shift/Ctrl+Click)
  - `selectMultiple(ids)` - Select multiple shapes
  - `toggleMultiple(ids)` - Toggle multiple shapes (drag selection)
  - `deselectAll()` - Clear selection
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Blue outline on all selected shapes
  - Unified bounding box with transform handles
  - Selection count in StylePanel: "Style (3 shapes)"
- **Backward Compatibility**: `selectedId` still available for single-selection cases

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Multi-Lock Acquisition & Group Transforms
- **Lock Management**:
  - `startEditingMultipleShapes()` - Acquire locks on all selected shapes
  - `finishEditingMultipleShapes()` - Release locks and commit to Firestore
  - **All-or-nothing locking**: If ANY shape is locked, entire operation fails
  - Toast notification: "üîí X shapes are locked by [User]"
- **Group Operations**:
  - **Drag**: Move all selected shapes together
  - **Resize**: Scale all selected shapes proportionally
  - **Rotate**: Rotate all selected shapes around center
  - All operations apply to ALL selected shapes simultaneously

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Drag Selection Box (Marquee/Lasso)
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Semi-transparent blue rectangle while dragging
  - Dashed border (#6366f1)
  - Scales correctly with zoom level
- **Selection Modes**:
  - **No modifier**: Replace current selection
  - **Shift/Ctrl held**: Toggle shapes in/out of selection
- **Smart Detection**: Only activates when clicking empty canvas (not on shapes)

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Property Editing (Batch Updates)
- **Supported Properties**: All property changes now apply to ALL selected shapes:
  - Fill color
  - Rotation
  - Font size (text)
  - Text alignment (text)
  - Text formatting: bold, italic, underline (text)
- **Visual Indicator**: Style panel shows "(X shapes)" when multiple selected
- **No Lock Required**: Property edits use last-write-wins (LWW) strategy

### ‚úÖ Performance Optimization
- **Color Picker Throttling**:
  - Local state update: **0ms** (instant visual feedback)
  - Firestore commit: **100ms debounce** after last change
  - Prevents lag when dragging color picker
  - Applies to all selected shapes simultaneously

## üîí Conflict Resolution Strategy

### Transformational Edits (REQUIRES LOCK)
**Operations**: Drag, Rotate, Resize  
**Behavior**:
- Acquires exclusive lock on ALL selected shapes before transform
- If ANY shape is locked by another user ‚Üí entire operation blocked
- Lock releases on mouse/touch release
- Other users see colored lock borders

**Example**:
```
User A: Selects 3 shapes, starts dragging
‚Üí Acquires locks on all 3 shapes
User B: Tries to drag any of those shapes
‚Üí Blocked with toast: "üîí Some shapes are being edited by Alice"
User A: Releases mouse
‚Üí All 3 shapes commit to Firestore, locks released
User B: Can now edit
```

### Property Edits (NO LOCK)
**Operations**: Fill color, opacity, text formatting, alignment, rotation input  
**Behavior**:
- No lock acquired
- Changes apply immediately to Firestore
- Last write wins (LWW) conflict resolution
- Real-time sync via RTDB

**Example**:
```
User A: Changes 3 shapes to red (no lock)
User B: Changes those same 3 shapes to blue (no lock)
Result: Shapes are blue (last write wins)
Note: Both users see updates in real-time
```

### Text Content Edits (EXCLUSIVE LOCK)
**Operations**: Double-click text editing  
**Behavior**:
- Clears multi-selection
- Acquires exclusive lock on single text shape
- Only one user can edit text content at a time

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Core Context & Services
1. **`src/contexts/CanvasContext.jsx`**
   - Added `selectedIds` (Set)
   - Added selection helper methods
   - Added `startEditingMultipleShapes()` and `finishEditingMultipleShapes()`
   - Backward compatibility for `selectedId`

2. **`src/services/realtimeShapes.js`**
   - Added `startEditingMultipleShapes()` - multi-lock acquisition
   - Added `finishEditingMultipleShapes()` - multi-lock release
   - All-or-nothing locking strategy

### UI Components
3. **`src/components/Canvas/Canvas.jsx`**
   - Updated to use `selectedIds` (Set)
   - Shift/Ctrl+Click toggle selection
   - Multi-select drag/transform handlers
   - Drag selection box (marquee) implementation
   - Multi-lock toast notifications

4. **`src/components/Canvas/StylePanel.jsx`**
   - Batch property updates for all selected shapes
   - Selection count indicator
   - Color picker throttling (100ms debounce)
   - Instant local preview for color changes

## üéØ Key Design Decisions

### 1. Both Shift and Ctrl Toggle (Not Additive vs Toggle)
- **User Request**: Simplified from original design
- **Behavior**: Both Shift and Ctrl/‚åò do the same thing (toggle)
- **Rationale**: Simpler mental model for users

### 2. All-or-Nothing Locking (MVP)
- **Behavior**: If ANY shape in selection is locked, block entire operation
- **Alternative**: Allow operation on unlocked shapes only
- **Decision**: Start simple, can enhance in v1.2

### 3. Property Edits Don't Require Locks
- **Operations**: Color, formatting, rotation input
- **Behavior**: Last-write-wins (LWW)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Non-spatial changes don't conflict geometrically
  - Reduces lock contention
  - Matches Figma behavior
  - Users expect immediate color feedback

### 4. Color Picker Debouncing
- **Problem**: User reported lag when dragging color picker
- **Solution**: 
  - Local state: instant (0ms)
  - Firestore: 100ms debounce
- **Result**: Feels responsive, reduces database writes
