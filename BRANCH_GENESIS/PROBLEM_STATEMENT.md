### Branch: feature/evaluator-tests-pr-1

### Purpose
Establish a comprehensive, preserving evaluation workflow for canvas approaches generated by swarm agents. Every defined test in `scripts/evaluate-canvas-approaches.ts` must be implemented, executable via npm scripts, and produce deterministic scoring across performance, collaboration, and code quality. The workflow must strictly preserve git history and commit messages, using merge commits (no fast-forward) and explicit, descriptive documentation for each change.

### Problem
- The evaluator currently runs placeholder commands (`test:performance`, `test:realtime`) that are not defined, causing fallback scoring and undermining selection accuracy.
- Branch evaluation checks out multiple branches without stashing/restore safeguards or returning to the original branch.
- There is no dedicated documentation-driven test plan aligned with repository standards (tasks docs, PR task files, integration summaries).
- Results are not persisted beyond console output, making auditability and regression analysis difficult.

### Goals
- Implement missing npm scripts and backing tests for performance and realtime collaboration.
- Ensure code quality checks integrate lint and test suites with clear pass/fail gates.
- Add safe branch switching: stash, capture current ref, evaluate, and restore.
- Persist results to a machine-readable artifact under `docs/` and print to stdout.
- Provide preserving git operations guidance (merge commits, no-ff) and add task documentation files per repo standards.

### Non-Goals
- Changing the scoring model beyond making it deterministic and tied to real checks.
- Replacing existing CI; we only add scripts and local automation hooks.

### Success Criteria
- `npm run swarm:evaluate -- --session <id>` executes without fallback paths and writes a results artifact.
- Branch switching is safe and reversible; original branch is restored even on failure.
- Documentation added: problem statement, actionable task list, and PR task file stub.
- All commits are descriptive and history is preserved when integrating work.
