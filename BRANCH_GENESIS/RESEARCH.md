#### Context and Goals
- Establish deterministic evaluator tests for performance, realtime collaboration, and code quality.
- Preserve git history across evaluation workflows; ensure branch safety and result persistence.

#### Open Questions
- What performance thresholds are realistic for canvas operations given current architecture?
- How to simulate multi-client realtime behavior reliably in tests (Firebase mocks vs. lightweight emulation)?

#### Key Findings
- TBD

#### Decisions
- TBD

#### Next Steps
- Draft performance test plan and metrics.
- Define realtime sync scenarios and fixtures.
- Align npm scripts and vitest setup with CI expectations.
