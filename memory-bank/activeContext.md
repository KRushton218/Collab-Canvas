## Active Decisions

### Tool Interaction Pattern
- **Current**: Click tool â†’ shape appears at center â†’ return to select mode
- **Consider**: Click tool â†’ enter draw mode â†’ click/drag to create â†’ stay in tool mode

### Presence List Location
- **Current**: Dropdown from navbar (toggleable)
- **Works well**: Keeps canvas clean, accessible when needed

### Shape Locking Strategy
- **Current**: Lock on drag/transform start, release on end
- **Works well**: Prevents conflicts without manual locking

## Known Issues
None currently blocking. V1.0 is stable and production-ready.

### Known Limitations (V1.0)
- Only rectangles render (Circle/Line/Text buttons exist but don't work)
- Desktop-only (mobile not optimized)
- No undo/redo yet
- No multi-select yet
