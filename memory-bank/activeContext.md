## Current Work Focus
**üìö Documentation Overhaul & Bug Discovery** (October 14, 2025)

**Recent Completion**: V1.0 Production Deployment  
**Live App**: https://collab-canvas-ed2fc.web.app  
**Current Phase**: Documentation cleanup and planning V1.1.0

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)

### Documentation Restructure ‚úÖ (October 14, 2025)
Completed major documentation update to transition from task-based to memory-bank workflow:

**New Documents Created**:
- ‚úÖ `current-todos.md` - Active task list for ongoing work
- ‚úÖ `testing-strategy.md` - Comprehensive testing approach with 45+ user stories
- ‚úÖ `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - Meta-document explaining changes

**Documents Updated**:
- ‚úÖ `PRD.md` - Added completion status, documented O(1) architecture evolution with rationale
- ‚úÖ `tasks.md` - Marked completed tasks (PRs 1-7), added final summary, marked as historical

**Key Documentation Decisions**:
1. **Architecture Evolution Documented**: Explained migration from array-based to O(1) per-shape with technical rationale
2. **Beyond-MVP Features Tracked**: 6 major enhancements documented (color picker, resize handles, visual locks, modern toolbar, profile photos, zoom controls)
3. **Testing Philosophy Formalized**: Manual testing approach with comprehensive user story suite providing full functional coverage
4. **Memory Bank as Primary Source**: PRD and tasks.md marked as historical, memory-bank/ now primary documentation

### Bug Discovery üêõ (October 14, 2025)
**Lock Border Persistence Issue**:
- **Symptom**: When dragging multiple shapes in sequence, lock borders persist on all shapes in the chain
- **Expected**: Lock border should only appear on currently locked shape
- **Impact**: Visual clutter, confusing lock state indication
- **Priority**: Medium (visual bug, doesn't affect functionality)
- **Status**: Newly discovered, needs investigation
- **Location**: `Canvas.jsx` lock border rendering logic

## Next Steps

### Post-V1.0 Actions
1. **Test Production Deployment**: Verify all features work in production
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check Firebase usage, user behavior
3. **Optional**: Create git tag v1.0.0 and push to remote
4. **Share**: Distribute live URL for user testing

### V1.1.0 Planning (Next Minor Release)
Planned features for next release:
1. **Circle Shape Rendering**: Add Circle component in Canvas.jsx
2. **Line/Arrow Shape Rendering**: Add Line/Arrow components
3. **Text Box Rendering**: Add Text component with editing
4. **Tool Mode Improvements**: Stay in draw mode after creating shape
5. **Shape Property Panel**: Edit shape properties post-creation

### V1.2.0 Planning
1. **Copy/Paste Shapes**: Keyboard shortcuts for duplication
2. **Multi-Select**: Select multiple shapes at once
3. **Undo/Redo**: Action history system

### V2.0.0 Planning (Major Release)
1. **Freehand Drawing Tool**: Brush/pen tool for free drawing
2. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch gestures, responsive UI
3. **User Permissions**: Viewer/editor roles
4. **Canvas Export**: PNG/SVG export functionality
5. **Multiple Projects**: Support for multiple canvases per user

## Active Decisions

### Tool Interaction Pattern
- **Current**: Click tool ‚Üí enter draw mode ‚Üí click to place default size or click/drag to size ‚Üí tool mode persists until changed (V/R/C/L/T, Esc)

### Pan & Zoom Interaction
- **Pan (Space Override)**: Holding Space enters pan mode and overrides shape interactions (no drag/transform on shapes while held)
- **Zoom**: Ctrl/‚åò + scroll (wheel zoom gated to modifier)

### Presence List Location
- **Current**: Dropdown from navbar (toggleable)
- **Works well**: Keeps canvas clean, accessible when needed

### Shape Locking Strategy
- **Current**: Lock on drag/transform start, release on end
- **Works well**: Prevents conflicts without manual locking

## Known Issues

### Active Bugs
1. **Lock Border Persistence** (Medium Priority) üêõ
   - Moving shapes in rapid sequence leaves lock borders on previous shapes
   - Expected: Only currently locked shape should show lock border
   - Location: Canvas.jsx - editingShapes state management
   - Impact: Visual confusion, doesn't affect functionality
   - Discovered: October 14, 2025

### Known Limitations (V1.0)
- Only rectangles render (Circle/Line/Text buttons exist but don't work)
- Desktop-only (mobile not optimized)
- No undo/redo yet
- No multi-select yet
- No export functionality yet
