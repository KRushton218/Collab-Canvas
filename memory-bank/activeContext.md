# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**UI/UX Enhancement Phase** - Recently completed major layout redesign and bug fixes.

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)

### Layout Redesign ✅
Completely overhauled the canvas interface with modern, professional design:

1. **Left Toolbar** (Floating, Vertically Centered)
   - Icon-based tool buttons: Select, Rectangle, Circle, Line, Text
   - Color picker with preset colors
   - Active state highlighting (indigo)
   - Smooth hover effects

2. **Bottom-Left Zoom Controls** (Relocated)
   - Compact horizontal layout
   - Zoom out/in buttons with icons
   - Current zoom percentage display
   - Reset view button
   - Disabled states at min/max zoom

3. **Navbar Enhancements**
   - Profile chip with photo/avatar dropdown
   - Google profile photo integration (with fallback)
   - Logout button in dropdown menu
   - Online users indicator (rightmost, expandable)
   - Presence list toggles on click

4. **Presence List Improvements**
   - Cleaner design with user avatars
   - Color-coded circles matching cursor colors
   - Current user highlighting
   - Online status indicators
   - Only shows when navbar button is clicked

### Bug Fixes ✅

1. **Konva Fill Warning**
   - Added validation for shape fill values
   - Default fallback to `#cccccc` for invalid/missing fills
   - Protection in `loadShapes()` and `subscribeToShapes()`

2. **Google Photo Display**
   - Fixed profile photo not loading for Google sign-in users
   - Added profile/email scopes to GoogleAuthProvider
   - Preserved photoURL when truncating display names
   - Added error handling with fallback to avatar circle
   - Added `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"` for CORS

### Design System
Established consistent styling across all components:
- **Primary Color**: Indigo (#6366f1)
- **Border Radius**: 12px (containers), 8px (buttons)
- **Shadow**: `0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)`
- **Border**: `1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`
- **Hover Effects**: Background color transitions
- **Typography**: Consistent font sizes and weights

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Shape Type Implementation**: Currently only rectangles render - need to add:
   - Circle rendering
   - Line/Arrow rendering
   - Text box rendering
2. **Tool Mode State**: Implement proper tool mode switching (currently all tools create shapes immediately)
3. **Shape Properties Panel**: Allow editing shape properties after creation

### Future Enhancements
1. **More Drawing Tools**: Freehand drawing, polygons
2. **Layers**: Z-index management for shapes
3. **Undo/Redo**: Action history
4. **Export**: Save canvas as image/JSON
5. **Comments**: Add comments/annotations to shapes
6. **Permissions**: Owner/editor/viewer roles

## Active Decisions

### Tool Interaction Pattern
- **Current**: Click tool → shape appears at center → return to select mode
- **Consider**: Click tool → enter draw mode → click/drag to create → stay in tool mode

### Presence List Location
- **Current**: Dropdown from navbar (toggleable)
- **Works well**: Keeps canvas clean, accessible when needed

### Shape Locking Strategy
- **Current**: Lock on drag/transform start, release on end
- **Works well**: Prevents conflicts without manual locking

## Known Issues
None currently blocking. System is stable and performant.
