## Current Work Focus
**‚ú® Text Editing & Formatting Enhancement** (October 15, 2025)

**Recent Completion**: Comprehensive text editing system with formatting controls  
**Live App**: https://collab-canvas-ed2fc.web.app  
**Current Phase**: Enhanced text UX matching Figma-like behavior

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)

### Text Editing System ‚úÖ (October 15, 2025)
Implemented complete text editing workflow with rich formatting controls:

**Core Text Features**:
1. ‚úÖ **Font Size Control**: Number input with auto-fit button
   - Intelligent auto-fit algorithm (0.55 char-width, padding-aware)
   - Scales text proportionally during resize transforms
   - Range: 8-512px with validation
   
2. ‚úÖ **Text Alignment**: Left/Center/Right toggle buttons
   - Visual feedback with indigo highlighting
   - Persists across edits and syncs in real-time

3. ‚úÖ **Text Formatting**: Bold, Italic, Underline toggles
   - Can combine multiple formats (e.g., bold + italic)
   - Applies to both canvas and edit overlay
   - Stored in Firestore: `fontStyle` and `textDecoration`

4. ‚úÖ **Inline Text Editing**: Double-click or create with text tool
   - Creates empty shape ‚Üí opens editor immediately
   - Styled textarea matches all formatting
   - Keyboard shortcuts: Esc to cancel, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter to save
   - Auto-deletes if empty on save/cancel

5. ‚úÖ **UX Improvements**:
   - Auto-switch to select tool after creating text
   - Delete/Backspace work in editor without deleting shape
   - Hand cursor (grab/grabbing) when holding Space
   - Custom cursor switches based on pan state

**Technical Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed rotation sync: only sends rotation angle to RTDB (not x/y)
- ‚úÖ Rotation merges correctly for remote viewers
- ‚úÖ Font size included in RTDB live updates and Firestore commits
- ‚úÖ Extended TextObject model with `fontStyle` and `textDecoration`
- ‚úÖ Updated shapes service to persist formatting attributes

**Commit**: `b554fa8` - "feat: Enhanced text editing with formatting controls and improved UX"

## Recent Changes (Previous Sessions)

### Documentation Restructure ‚úÖ (October 14, 2025)
Completed major documentation update to transition from task-based to memory-bank workflow:

**New Documents Created**:
- ‚úÖ `current-todos.md` - Active task list for ongoing work
- ‚úÖ `testing-strategy.md` - Comprehensive testing approach with 45+ user stories
- ‚úÖ `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - Meta-document explaining changes

**Documents Updated**:
- ‚úÖ `PRD.md` - Added completion status, documented O(1) architecture evolution with rationale
- ‚úÖ `tasks.md` - Marked completed tasks (PRs 1-7), added final summary, marked as historical

**Key Documentation Decisions**:
1. **Architecture Evolution Documented**: Explained migration from array-based to O(1) per-shape with technical rationale
2. **Beyond-MVP Features Tracked**: 6 major enhancements documented (color picker, resize handles, visual locks, modern toolbar, profile photos, zoom controls)
3. **Testing Philosophy Formalized**: Manual testing approach with comprehensive user story suite providing full functional coverage
4. **Memory Bank as Primary Source**: PRD and tasks.md marked as historical, memory-bank/ now primary documentation

### Bug Discovery üêõ (October 14, 2025)
**Lock Border Persistence Issue**:
- **Symptom**: When dragging multiple shapes in sequence, lock borders persist on all shapes in the chain
- **Expected**: Lock border should only appear on currently locked shape
- **Impact**: Visual clutter, confusing lock state indication
- **Priority**: Medium (visual bug, doesn't affect functionality)
- **Status**: Newly discovered, needs investigation
- **Location**: `Canvas.jsx` lock border rendering logic

## Active Decisions

### Tool Interaction Pattern
- **Current**: Click tool ‚Üí enter draw mode ‚Üí click to place default size or click/drag to size ‚Üí tool mode persists until changed (V/R/C/L/T, Esc)

### Pan & Zoom Interaction
- **Pan (Space Override)**: Holding Space enters pan mode and overrides shape interactions (no drag/transform on shapes while held)
- **Zoom**: Ctrl/‚åò + scroll (wheel zoom gated to modifier)

### Presence List Location
- **Current**: Dropdown from navbar (toggleable)
- **Works well**: Keeps canvas clean, accessible when needed

### Shape Locking Strategy
- **Current**: Lock on drag/transform start, release on end
- **Works well**: Prevents conflicts without manual locking

## Known Issues

### Active Bugs
1. **Lock Border Persistence** (Medium Priority) üêõ
   - Moving shapes in rapid sequence leaves lock borders on previous shapes
   - Expected: Only currently locked shape should show lock border
   - Location: Canvas.jsx - editingShapes state management
   - Impact: Visual confusion, doesn't affect functionality
   - Discovered: October 14, 2025

### Known Limitations
- Desktop-only (mobile not optimized)
- No undo/redo yet
- No multi-select yet
- No export functionality yet
- Text wrapping is basic (Konva default behavior)
