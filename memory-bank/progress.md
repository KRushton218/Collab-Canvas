## Current Status

**ðŸŽ‰ V1.0 DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION** (October 14, 2025)

**Live URL**: https://collab-canvas-ed2fc.web.app  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Phase**: Production - First stable release  
**Stability**: Production-ready for basic rectangle collaboration  
**Performance**: Tested with 5-10 concurrent users, <500 shapes  
**Test Coverage**: 64/64 tests passing âœ…  
**Next Milestone**: V1.1.0 - Implement remaining shape types (Circle, Line, Text)

### Deployment Details
- âœ… Deployed to Firebase Hosting
- âœ… Database rules deployed (Firestore + RTDB)
- âœ… Bundle size: 1.21 MB (326 KB gzipped)
- âœ… Version tagged: v1.0.0
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation (CHANGELOG, Release Notes)

### Documentation Status (October 14, 2025)
- âœ… Documentation restructure completed
- âœ… Memory bank now primary documentation source
- âœ… PRD.md and tasks.md marked as historical
- âœ… current-todos.md created for active work
- âœ… testing-strategy.md created with 45+ user stories
- âœ… Architecture evolution and rationale documented

## Known Limitations

1. **Mobile**: Desktop-optimized, mobile needs work
2. **Scale**: Tested with <500 shapes, performance with 1000+ unknown
3. **Concurrent Users**: Tested with 5-10 users, higher load untested

## Known Bugs

### âœ… Lock Border Persistence (Resolved)
Resolved by limiting local `editingShapes` to the active shape on start, clearing on drag/transform end, and clearing on deselect.
