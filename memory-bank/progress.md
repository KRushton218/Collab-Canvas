## Current Status

**🎉 V1.0 DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION** (October 14, 2025)

**Live URL**: https://collab-canvas-ed2fc.web.app  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Phase**: Production - First stable release  
**Stability**: Production-ready for basic rectangle collaboration  
**Performance**: Tested with 5-10 concurrent users, <500 shapes  
**Test Coverage**: 64/64 tests passing ✅  
**Next Milestone**: V1.1.0 - Implement remaining shape types (Circle, Line, Text)

### Deployment Details
- ✅ Deployed to Firebase Hosting
- ✅ Database rules deployed (Firestore + RTDB)
- ✅ Bundle size: 1.21 MB (326 KB gzipped)
- ✅ Version tagged: v1.0.0
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (CHANGELOG, Release Notes)

## Known Limitations

1. **Shape Types**: Only rectangles render currently (Circle/Line/Text UI exists but not functional)
2. **Tool Modes**: All tools create shapes immediately (no draw mode)
3. **Mobile**: Desktop-optimized, mobile needs work
4. **Scale**: Tested with <500 shapes, performance with 1000+ unknown
5. **Concurrent Users**: Tested with 5-10 users, higher load untested
