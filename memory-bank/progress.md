## What's Left to Build ðŸš§

### Shape Types (High Priority)
- [ ] Circle shape rendering
- [ ] Line/Arrow shape rendering
- [ ] Text box implementation
- [ ] Shape type validation

### Tool Modes
- [ ] Proper tool mode state management
- [ ] Draw mode interaction patterns
- [ ] Tool mode persistence
- [ ] Escape to cancel/return to select

### Shape Features
- [ ] Shape fill color editing (after creation)
- [ ] Shape stroke/border options
- [ ] Copy/paste shapes
- [ ] Duplicate shapes
- [ ] Select multiple shapes
- [ ] Group shapes

### Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Freehand drawing
- [ ] Text editing (double-click to edit)

- [ ] User permissions (owner/editor/viewer)
- [ ] Private/public canvases
- [ ] Canvas sharing/invites
- [ ] Activity history

### Polish
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts help
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Error boundaries
- [ ] Offline support
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Touch gestures

## Current Status

**Phase**: Core functionality complete, UI redesign finished
**Stability**: Stable, production-ready for basic rectangle collaboration
**Performance**: Good (tested with multiple users)
**Next Milestone**: Implement remaining shape types (Circle, Line, Text)

## Known Limitations

1. **Shape Types**: Only rectangles render currently
2. **Tool Modes**: All tools create shapes immediately (no draw mode)
3. **Mobile**: Desktop-optimized, mobile needs work
4. **Scale**: Tested with <500 shapes, performance with 1000+ unknown
5. **Concurrent Users**: Tested with 5-10 users, higher load untested
