## Current Status

**ðŸŽ‰ V1.0 DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION** (October 14, 2025)

**Live URL**: https://collab-canvas-ed2fc.web.app  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Phase**: Production - First stable release  
**Stability**: Production-ready for basic rectangle collaboration  
**Performance**: Tested with 5-10 concurrent users, <500 shapes  
**Test Coverage**: 64/64 tests passing âœ…  
**Next Milestone**: V1.1.0 - Implement remaining shape types (Circle, Line, Text)

### Deployment Details
- âœ… Deployed to Firebase Hosting
- âœ… Database rules deployed (Firestore + RTDB)
- âœ… Bundle size: 1.21 MB (326 KB gzipped)
- âœ… Version tagged: v1.0.0
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation (CHANGELOG, Release Notes)

### Documentation Status (October 14, 2025)
- âœ… Documentation restructure completed
- âœ… Memory bank now primary documentation source
- âœ… PRD.md and tasks.md marked as historical
- âœ… current-todos.md created for active work
- âœ… testing-strategy.md created with 45+ user stories
- âœ… Architecture evolution and rationale documented

## Known Limitations

1. **Mobile**: Desktop-optimized, mobile needs work
2. **Scale**: Tested with <500 shapes, performance with 1000+ unknown
3. **Concurrent Users**: Tested with 5-10 users, higher load untested

## Known Bugs

### âœ… Ghost Shapes (Resolved - October 15, 2025)
**Issue**: Shapes would "jump back" to old positions when moved quickly due to RTDB clearing before Firestore propagated.  
**Resolution**: Reordered sync sequence to wait for Firestore completion (400ms propagation) before clearing RTDB.

### âœ… Selection Box Not Working (Resolved - October 15, 2025)
**Issue**: Click-and-drag selection only worked when clicking directly on Stage, making it nearly impossible in dense canvases.  
**Resolution**: Relaxed click detection to accept clicks on Stage, Layer, and background elements.

### âœ… Performance Degradation During Multi-Selection (Resolved - October 15, 2025)
**Issue**: Dragging 10 shapes sent 300 RTDB writes/second, causing lag and throttling.  
**Resolution**: Implemented batched RTDB updates using multi-path updates (90-95% reduction in writes).

### âœ… Lock Border Persistence (Resolved - October 15, 2025)
**Issue**: Lock borders persisted on shapes after multi-selection drag ended.  
**Resolution**: Explicitly clear `editingShapes` state after `finishEditingMultipleShapes()` and flush pending batch updates.

### âœ… Unnecessary Re-renders (Resolved - October 15, 2025)
**Issue**: Merge logic created new shape objects on every RTDB update, causing excessive re-renders.  
**Resolution**: Converted to `useMemo` with reference preservation when values haven't changed.

**No known bugs at this time** âœ¨
